### discord-extensions
Easily add chrome extensions to your discord install. Currently only supports linux, although windows support is coming soon.

# Installing
I'll upload this package to npm some time, I want to support windows first, though. In the meantime this will work fine.
```
git clone https://github.com/tobeqz/discord-extensions.git
cd discord-extensions
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```
